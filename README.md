# CS60075-Team28-Task-1



### Older experiments
Conda env setup is only required for initial preprocessing, which was done earlier. We shifted to colab after this. 
* `conda env create -f env.yml`
* `conda activate nlpTask1`
* `preprocess.py [-h] --file FILE`
* `eval.py [-h] --submission_foldername SUBMISSION_FOLDERNAME --reference_filename REFERENCE_FILENAME`
